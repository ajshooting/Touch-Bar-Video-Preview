A small open source app to display your designs on the Touch Bar of the new MacBook Pro.

## Install

[Download](https://github.com/touchbar/Touch-Bar-Preview/releases/latest), unzip, and drag the app to Applications folder. Touch Bar Preview requires macOS 10.12.2 or higher.

## Instructions
**To use Touch Bar Preview just drag and drop a image file (PNG, JPEG) into the app.**
The image should be 2170px wide and 60px high. Since the Touch Bar is a high-resolution Retina display, this is equivalent to 1085pt by 30pt.

The app automatically cuts out the System button (esc) and Control Strip so you **don't** have to exclude them in your design!
If your image is bigger or smaller than the required size, the image is currently stretched to fit into the app region.

Read more about the Touch Bar in the [Apple HIG](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/AbouttheTouchBar.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000957-CH104-SW1).
